This is a network installer for
BunsenLabs Linux on Debian Stretch.

It will use the BunsenLabs Helium Apt repository
to download and install necessary packages,
along with packages from the Debian repositories,
and do any other necessary configuration.

While there is a good chance of installing a working system,
please be ready to deal with any bugs that show up!
